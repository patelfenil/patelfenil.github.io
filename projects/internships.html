                    <p>I interned at AdWyze, during summer 2016. AdWyze is a marketing optimization platform, which allows marketers to improve the performance of their marketing budgets. It has won the 1st prize at MIT Global Startup Labs, won FB Ads API access after winning a hackathon beating out other companies in APAC. Have also been selected for Google Launch pad. Currently working with Indiaâ€™s top 3 e-tailers in private beta.</p>
                    <p>During my internship I did most of my work on the backend of different platform features like ad creation and management. I also did a lot of work on integrating many analytics APIs to the platform for system analysis. Mixpanel analysis, Full story, New relic are some of the APIs that I worked with. I also took part in intra-hackathon organized in AdWyze during which I contributed to building a chrome extension that shows the analytic data from AdWyze on the chrome homepage. My co-workers and mentors were extremely talented and I kept learning new things from them every day. I had an amazing experience there and I thoroghly enjoyed my stay in Bangalore.</p>

                    <p>I interned at Houseafic, Mutiny Labs during winter 2015. Houseafic is a startup trying to disrupt the monopoly of current real estate builders in India by shifting the focus to the customers. The idea is to change the current dynamics of the market by empowering the buyer to make better desicions. Houseafic endeavours to provide the accurate information to the people about what they are actually buying.</p>
                    <p> During my internship I worked on many different features of the platform. I worked with Parse and Javascript for enchancing and debugging the features. I also worked with sengrid smptp web api for sending dynamic emails regarding the various events occuring on the platform. I automated the image cropping procedure to enhance the UX of project view. I got to learn a lot during the internship and the experience exposed me to real-life problems in industry.</p>
